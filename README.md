## CESS:Cumulus Encrypted Storage System  
CESS is a distributed cloud data network with user friendly ledgers, novel consensus mechanism, multiple data authenticity proof schemes, and reliable network infrastructure. CESS offers data storage service with the advantages of low cost, privacy protection, security and robustness. With the implementation of CESS data confirmation and proxy re-encryption technology, CESS provides Web3.0 clients and DAPPs with trustworthy, secure and reliable data rights protection. 

Compared to the similar projects in the Polkadot ecosystem including Ocean, DataHighway and Bluzelle, CESS storage service features:

* Encrypted data storage
* Multiple copies (3 copies by default, more upon request)
* Sharded and distributed on multiple nodes
* Highly scalable storage space
* Transactions secured by CESS blockchain
* Data rights protection for data owners
* Competitive cost
